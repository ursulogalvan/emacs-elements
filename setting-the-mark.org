Marks can be set, activated and popped.
Marks are used for selecting text (regions) and navigating in a buffer and in recent buffers.

_Setting the mark_

C-SPC Sets the mark at point and activates it (set-mark-command).
C-x C-x (exchange-point-and-mark)
C-u C-x C-x leaves the mark inactive and the region unhighlighted

_Marking text objects_

C-M-SPC (mark-word)

ari-function Or is it not rather the case that just as the eye and hand and foot and in fact every member [of the body] has some function, so too one must posit some function to man [as a whole] in addition to the functions his respective members possess? AE 1,7

M-# mark-end-of-sentence.
C-M-@ (mark-sexp) symbolic expression
M-h (mark-paragraph) paragraph
C-M-h (mark-defun) define function
C-x C-p (mark-page) *Note: C-q C-l inserts a page* ^L
C-x h (mark-whole-buffer)


_Navigation_
You can also use the Mark to remember a position in the buffer by typing C-SPC C-SPC, and later jump back there by typing C-u C-SPC.

_Mark-ring_

When we set a new mark or deactivate a mark we PUSH the old mark to the mark-ring (to the top of a stack of old marks). When we invoke C-u SPC we move the mark at the top of the stack back to its original position and restore the mark.

_Setting Mark with yank_

isa26:20 Come, my people, enter your chambers, And shut your doors behind you; Hide yourself, as it were, for a little moment.

Many commands that insert text, such as C-y (yank), set the mark at the other end of the inserted text, without activating it. This lets you easily return to that position. you can tell that a command does this when it shows ‘Mark set’ in the echo area.

_The Global Mark Ring_

C-x C-SPC (pop-global-mark) jumps to the buffer and position of the latest entry in the global ring. It also rotates the ring, so that successive uses of C-x C-SPC take you to earlier buffers and mark positions.

C-c & (org-mark-ring-goto) jumps to previous position in the mark ring

_How do I view the mark ring?_

C-h v mark-ring
C-h v global-mark-ring
