Nice tweaks, and a great video idea!
You can make your find-config-file function a bit nicer by using the user-init-file variable in place of a hardcoded path.

I think that the small binding tweaks I use most often are binding M-r to query-replace, M-n/p to forward/backward-paragraph, C-x C-b to bs-show, and C-' to comment-line

Another commenter mentioned evil-mode, but if you want some vi-style modality without installing anything, then you could try M-x viper-mode. It's not as advanced as evil-mode, but it changes less and might be easier to use with your existing config.

I find that winner-mode is a nice feature to enable, it allows you to undo/redo changes to the internal window layout.
