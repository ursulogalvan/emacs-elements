- Big, intimidating and powerful program
- Completion frameworks: ido, ivy, icomplete, consult+selectrum 
- Icicles enhances minibuffer completion
- So much info on it
- Where to start?

*Icicles* and *Minibuf*

Bolsters and supplements default Emacs Menu

- Basic concept: use tab completion

- =M-x=
- Type some text =org-= =emacs=
- Press =tab=
- Continue to type some text
- Press =tab=
- To select a candidate press =tab= =tab=
- =<RET>= to select candidate

- Then we have =shift-tab= which gives us regexp completion.

=emacs=
=^emacs=
=emacs$
=-emacs-
=^pack.+nts=

=Shift-alt-*=

orderless

init 
emacs

- We follow the same process but get *different* suggestions

- icicles is based on vanilla Emacs. It tries to leave defaults as much as possible in tact. You will not for instance see completion candidates displayed until you hit `TAB' (or `S-TAB') as with some other completion frameworks which begin to show them as you type. This default behaviour can be changed.

- I suggest you start with defaults before changing anything to get a sense of how the program works by default. 

- help 

type =M-?= in the minibuffer

=M-S-TAB= or =ESC S-TAB= provides help with keys (similar to which-key)

#+begin_example
e.g. type =C-h= and then =shift-tab=
e.g. type =f1= and then =shift-tab=
#+end_example

- Even if you use no other features of icicles than these, it will be a 100% booster for your work. 

- You can turn off =icy-mode= any time to get back to vanilla Emacs. 

- Its effects:

- org-roam completion
- buffer (=C-x b=)
- opening files
- =M-x=
- =C-h v=
