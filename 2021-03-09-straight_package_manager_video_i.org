- An exciting "cutting edge" package manager https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el
- I have relied largely on the online documentation to produce this video.

*Why Straight?*

With Straight one can:

- Install Emacs packages listed on MELPA, GNU ELPA, or Emacsmirror, or provide your own recipes.
- Packages are cloned as Git or other repos
- You can basically install any package in existence, e.g. icicles, bookmark+
- One can use *version lockfiles* to ensure 100% reproducibility of your Emacs configuration.
- You can install your packages manually and Straight.el will load them for you. Or you can also have Straight.el install your packages, while you provide the recipes explicitly.
- One can use Straight to try out a package without installing it.
  =M-x Straight-use-package=
- Helps to solves bugs with Emacs -Q
- takes a minute or two to update all your packages, but does not overwrite your local changes
  https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#version-control-operations
- Program does a great deal. I like the simplicity of it.

Note:

- supports a minimum version of Emacs 25.1
- you must have *git* installed to use Straight
- make changes to a package simply by editing its source code
- straight.el does not provide any user interface for package management
- One area of murkiness: what is Straight's relationship to use-package
- Straight /replaces/ package.el but *not* use-package
- One would not use package.el and straight.el together (not recommended)
- One can use Straight and use-package together
- One can use Straight alone without use-package!
- I have used both Straight and use-package together, and now I use only Straight
- More of that in a moment

*config*

#+begin_src
(defvar bootstrap-version) ;; Straight
(let ((bootstrap-file
       (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))
      (bootstrap-version 5))
  (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
    (with-current-buffer
	(url-retrieve-synchronously
	 "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el"
	 'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (eval-print-last-sexp)))
  (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))
#+end_src

Set these customisations:

set =straight-repository-branch= "develop"
set =package-enable-at-startup= nil -- if you run Emacs 27 or above

*Make sure you remove:*

- all code that relates to package.el: i.e. references to package-initialise, package-archives, etc.
- NOTE: The variable =use-package-always-ensure= is associated with package.el, and you should not use it with straight.el.

*How to install packages with Straight*

#+begin_example
(straight-use-package 'lorem-ipsum)
#+end_example

*How to get Straight to work /with/ use-package*

- first install use-package with straight.el:
=(straight-use-package 'use-package)=

- set =straight-use-package-by-default= t -- If you use use-package, it will invoke straight.el to install the package

NOTE: do not use :ensure t syntax (which is for package.el) but :straight t
NOTE: Specifying :straight t in use-package syntax is not necessary if you set =straight-use-package-by-default= to t.

#+begin_example
(use-package org-roam
  :straight t
  :after org
  :hook
      (after-init . org-roam-mode)
  :bind (("C-h /" . org-roam-find-file)
	     ([f8] . org-roam-find-file)
	     ("C-c i" . 'org-roam-insert)
	     ("C-c o" . 'org-roam-find-directory))
      :config
      (setq org-roam-db-update-method 'immediate)
      (setq org-roam-completion-system 'default)
      (setq org-roam-dailies-directory "~/org-roam/daily"))
#+end_example

You can disable use-package integration entirely by customising =straight-enable-use-package-integration=.

*Where you packages are stored*
The local repositories are kept in ~/.emacs.d/straight/repos
The built packages are kept in ~/.emacs.d/straight/build

*How do I uninstall a package?*
Under package.el, every package on disk gets loaded into Emacs, whether you asked for it or not. Under straight.el, only the packages you explicitly mention in your init-file get loaded into Emacs.
