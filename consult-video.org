*Note*
I am using the default Consult Use-package example

https://github.com/minad/consult#use-package-example

*Important search/navigation commands*

* consult-buffer

C-x b

- Previews
- Works with selectrum quick-keys
- narrow list of choices with a prefix key: f,b,m

Supported narrowing keys:

b Buffers
f Files (Requires recentf-mode)
m Bookmarks
p Project (only available if consult-project-root-function is configured as shown in the example configuration).

- if you press DEL (Backspace) afterwards, the full candidate list will be shown again.
- You can show virtual buffers. It is enabled by default if you have recentf-mode enabled.
- It is possible to configure the list of sources via:

~consult-buffer-sources~

- To disable preview:

~consult-preview-key~ ~nil~

* consult-isearch

M-s e

Narrow to literal or regex expressions

* consult-line

Equivalent to Swiper command

M-s l

Select from matching lines. Supports live preview and recursive editing of the preview. 

One can search for the symbol at point (M-s l M-n M-n).

=symbol-at-point=

One can switch from isearch to consult-line

* consult-outline

M-g o

Jump to the heading of the outline.
Very helpful with org-files
Supports live preview and recursive editing

* consult-imenu (narrowing)

M-g i

presents a flat list of the Imenu with live preview and narrowing support

e.g. to quickly access functions in you init.el

* consult-grep/ripgrep

M-s g

If consult-grep is invoked with prefix argument C-u M-s g, you can specify the directory manually. Otherwise the default-directory is searched.

If you use Embark you can export the matches found by consult-grep, consult-ripgrep and consult-git-grep to a Grep buffer, where the matches across files can be edited, if the wgrep package is installed.

* consult-yank-pop

M-y

Browse the kill ring

*There are more "hidden gems"*

* Commands that boost one's use of the Emacs registry

M-' consult-register-store
M-# consult-register-load

#+begin_example
M-' a -> Store point in a

      POINT

M-' a -> Store region in a if a region is marked

Nullam rutrum.  Nam vestibulum accumsan nisl.

M-' M-w a -> Store window configuration in a

* Conclusion

- A few more consult features will be discussed also in my next video on Embark
- Robust
- Modern
- Works very well with Selectrum
- Makes it easier to do one's work
