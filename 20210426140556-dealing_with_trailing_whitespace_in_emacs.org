* Trailing whitespace :whitespace:emacs_elements:

  The term refers to unnecessary spaces _at the end of a line_ and also to empty lines _at the end of a buffer_

* How can I show trailing whitespace?

** You can show *trailing whitespace* =at the end of a line= by setting this variable:

=show-trailing-whitespace t=

Note: One can change the face of trailing whitespace when this variable is activated:

=M-x customize-face trailing-whitespace=

Note: If point is at the end of the line this feature does not apply as it would be too unseemly.

** To show *empty lines at the end of the buffer:*

=(setq-default indicate-empty-lines t)=

The empty lines are indicate in the fringe.

* How to deal with trailing whitespace?

* Non-aggressive approach

=M-x delete-trailing-whitespace= deletes all trailing whitespace

This command deletes all extra spaces at the end of each line in the buffer and all empty lines at the end of the buffer.

=(global-set-key (kbd "C-c w") 'delete-trailing-whitespace)=

* More aggressive approach

=M-x whitespace-cleanup=

* More complex solutions

=whitespace-mode= lets you visualise many kinds of whitespace in the buffer

You can customize your whitespace style by setting this variable:

=whitespace-style=

Note: One would not require this mode *and* show-trailing-whitespace

* Miscellaneous

=M-SPC= -- delete extra spaces between words

=delete-blank-lines= -- delete extra blank lines between paragraphs

=next-line-add-newlines= -- prevents adding newlines at end of buffer with arrow key
