* Primary choices

DOT EMACS .emacs -- in the root of your home folder ~/
Or,
INIT.EL -- in ~/.emacs.d

* Secondary choices

use-package with its own unique syntax
allows you to isolate package configuration
install packages
limits: putting code into use-package syntax is not always straightforward
why use-package is fast: it delays the loading of packages

 (require 'use-package))

* Package Managers

package.el that comes bundled with Emacs
Package archives: Elpa, Melpa, Org

Straight
https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el

Quelpa

* Important Question

For customisations should I edit my dot Emacs directly? Or should I use the Emacs built in customization options?

E.g.

#+begin_src
(setq package-archives
      '(("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
	("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")))
#+end_src

~setq~ allows one to directly modify several different variables in one expression, organize one's configuration and make one's init easily transferable across systems.

Or,
=M-x customize-set-variable=

E.g. gnus-init-file

Or, Customize UI "package-archives"

=M-x customize=

(defalias 'cz 'customize)

setq versus customize

Drew Adams argues for *customize*

=M-x customize-set-variable= is better for a user option than using ~setq~ in general.

See https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/106/105 for the technical issues

If you are going to use "customize" then have your customized settings go into a file different from your init.el file.

#+begin_src
(setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/.emacs-custom.el")
(load custom-file)
#+end_src

This way one's hand-written code is separate from the automatic code written by customize (Drew)

Emacs start-up time

=M-x emacs-init-time=

* Summary

- .emacs or init.el
- Use-package or not
- The choice of a package manager
- =setq= versus =customize=
