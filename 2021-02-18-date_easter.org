*Moon quarters*

To find out the quarters of the moon:

- Type "M" when in Calendar.
- Type M-x lunar-phases when *not* in calendar

*STEP 1*

Find out when is the first FULL MOON *after* March 21.

March 21 is the approximate date of the so-called March equinox. There are two equinoxes a year, one in March (the Autumnal Equinox) and one in September (the Vernal Equinox). Equinox means 'equal night' and on the  Equinoxes the day and night are of the same length. (Note: the *real* date of the equinox might be a day or two different from March 21).

*STEP 2*

Then find out what is the first Sunday after /that/ full moon. That Sunday will be Easter Sunday. If the full moon falls on a Sunday, Easter will be the Sunday FOLLOWING.

*Holidays*

h -- display holiday for day e.g. 17 Feb
x -- Mark holidays
u -- unmark the calendar

5 weeks after Easter is rogation Sunday
