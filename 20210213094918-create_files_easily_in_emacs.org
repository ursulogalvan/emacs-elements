TWO GROUPS OF METHODS

* THOSE METHODS THAT create and open file for editing

- C-x C-f -- basic method
  
  Allows you to choose your path, create a file + open the newly created file for editing.

- C-x b 
 [name-of-buffer]
 Find directory
 C-x C-w (this warns if a file of the same name exists)
 Chooses buffer name as file name on RET

* Those methods that create the file and do not open it for editing

- dired-create-empty-file

Prompts for path + file-name, but does not open file for editing. 

- M-! touch + the name of file -- create a new file anywhere.

Uses a relative path. I.e. the directory you are currently in. 
Does not prompt for a directory. 

This also works in the dired buffer.

Also note: the files are not automatically opened after this

- For many creating multiple files use the terminal

touch file1 file2 file3
