Emacs Manual p. 443-451.

Emacs has many settings one can change.

Most settings are /customizable variables/, which are also called /user options/.

*M-x customize* creates a customization buffer (also known as the CUI)

One can easily search this buffer, but note that this feature only finds groups and settings that are loaded in the current Emacs session.

These are organised into customization groups

If you are interested in customizing a particular setting or customization group, you can go straight there with these commands

*M-x customize-option*
*M-x customize-face*
*M-x customize-group*
*M-x customize-apropos* (similar to searching in the customization buffer)
*M-x customize-browse* (is another way to browse the available settings. This command creates a special customization buffer, which shows only the names of groups and settings, in a structured layout.)
*M-x customize-changed-options* (sets up a customization buffer with all the options whose meaning or default values have changed since Emacs version /version/).
*M-x customize-saved* (set up a customization buffer containing all settings that you have saved with customization buffers) *great*
