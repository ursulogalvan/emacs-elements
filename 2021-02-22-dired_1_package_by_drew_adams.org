*Turn on showkey-log-mode*

* Installation
https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiredPlus
Manually download dired+ to a folder in your .emacs.d folder
https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/dired%2b.el
Then tell Emacs where to find the file:
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/dired+")
Then,
byte-compile-file
(require 'dired+)

* Wraparound Navigation
;;  In vanilla Dired, `dired-next-marked-file' (`M-}' or `* C-n') and
;;  `dired-previous-marked-file' (`M-{' or `* C-p') wrap around when
;;  you get to the end or the beginning of the Dired buffer.  Handy.
;;
;;  But the other navigation commands do not wrap around.  In `Dired+'
;;  they do, provided option `diredp-wrap-around-flag' is non-nil,
;;  which it is by default.  This means the following commands:
;;
;;    `diredp-next-line'     - `n', `C-n', `down', `SPC'
;;    `diredp-previous-line' - `p', `C-p', `up'
;;    `diredp-next-dirline'  - `>'
;;    `diredp-prev-dirline'  - `<'
;;    `diredp-next-subdir'   - `C-M-n'
;;    `diredp-prev-subdir'   - `C-M-p'

* Some personal Dired+ customisation options
 '(diredp-hide-details-initially-flag t)
 '(diredp-wrap-around-flag nil)

Use customize-option to customise these

* One customised face
 '(diredp-compressed-file-suffix ((t (:foreground "orange"))))

Use customize-face to customise this

Note: you can customize a face to have the same appearance as face `default' 

* If You Use Dired+ on MS Windows

Dired+ loads library w32-browser.el if Emacs is running on Microsoft Windows, using it to extend Dired in a few ways.

- M-RET -- Open a file in Windows in its default app
- C-RET -- Open Windows Explorer on a file or folder
- ^ - Get a list of drives on your computer (great!)

'(diredp-w32-local-drives '(("C:" "Local disk") ("E:" "Local disk")))

You will need w32-browser.el (which you need to put in your `load-path' and `require', if you want to use it.)
